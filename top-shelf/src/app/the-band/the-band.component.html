	        			<div class="my-3">I was born and raised in San Diego California and started performing in front of a crowd at the age of 4. I sang all through elementary and middle school years and in High school, joined chorus and musical theater, where I played the roles of &quot;Sandy&quot; in &quot;Grease&quot;,  &quot;Kim McAfee&quot; in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and many more.  I have performed at numerous weddings and San Diego vocal competitions.  In my early 20&apos;s, I chose to put my music on hold to be a full-time mother of three.  Over the next fifteen years, I only sang at church and small events until joining the Orange Park Chorale in 2013. In April 2017, I joined Top Shelf and am having the time of my life!!  My biggest vocal influences are Karen Carpenter and Trisha Yearwood.</div>

		        		<div class="pl-3">I grew up in Orlando, FL in a home with no rock and roll music.  I started playing the guitar in high school and began playing music with various bands in bars and clubs in 1974.  Over time this became a full time touring gig playing bars and clubs around the country until 1983.  There were plenty of years we played over 300 nights a year.  We opened many shows for national acts such as The Allman Brothers, Molly Hatchet, 38 Special, Tom Petty, Pat Benatar, Cheap Trick, Rare Earth and Joan Jett.  In 1983, I stopped chasing my dream of musical stardom.  I cut off my hair, took off my earing, put away my rock and roll life and signed up for college.  I ended up a banker and banking has been very good to me.  In 2013, I picked up the guitar for the first time in 30 years and literally have not put it down since.  I&apos;m so thankful that I rediscovered the guitar and found great musicians to play with.  There is nothing like seeing people react to music &mdash; with a smile, tap of the toe, singing the lyrics or dancing on the floor.</div>

	        			<p>Music has always been the big love of my life. It still can bring me to the highest highs and many times has brought me to the lowest lows in my life. If anyone ever tells you being a musician is easy, they have never really put much effort towards their talent. I started with my first actual band in the 1970&apos;s and after three years that band morphed into the band called the Attitudes. We were basically an all original music band writing close to if not more than 100 original songs. We acquired quite a following in Jacksonville FL. Opening for acts such as Berlin, The Romantics, The Call, The Producers, Marshall Tucker, and U-2. Our talent was spotted by the late Robert Nix (former  drummer  for Roy Orbison and The Atlanta Rhythm Section) and as a result we signed and recorded 25 of our original songs with Capricorn Records in the early 80&apos;s. Due to the sudden death of Frank Fenter, Vice President of Capricorn Records at that time, The Attitudes were left in limbo and we eventually disbanded. In the mid 80&apos;s I formed a Christian band with lead singer J.R. Roberts and co-wrote many songs of which 4 were played on a regular basis on FM-88 in Jacksonville. Because of the love for my growing family I laid down my playing for over ten years to make sure they were taken care of after which I started leading praise and worship for meetings at many churches. After another long hiatus our drummer (Lisa Dardis) approached me several times about playing in the band she was playing in and after much deliberation I said yes. That band has since become the awesome group of musicians and friends that I am proud to be a part of called Top Shelf.</p>

	        			<p>I was bitten by the music bug on 9 February, 1964 and bought my first guitar for $15 in later that year.  I have been playing music ever since. My first band was formed in 1967 and was called &quot;The Mod 3&quot;. I gigged my way through high school playing the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Black Sabbath, Iron Butterfly, CCR, Grand Funk Railroad, and many other artists from that era. In 1973, I started playing the Bass and played and recorded with a band called Fantasy.</p>
						<p>In 1974, I enlisted in the Navy and performed with a band everywhere I was stationed. Played all the Bermuda service clubs in 1981, on the flight deck of the US Aircraft Carrier (USS Saratoga CV-60) as she transited the Suez Canal in 1990, as well as, playing with bands in Subic Bay, PI in 1988, Diego Garcia BIOT in 1995, and many other ports around the world.</p> 
						<p>I retired from the Navy in 1997.  From 1998 - 2002, I played bass and provided and operated the sound equipment for the band &quot;High Tide&quot; Jacksonville Beaches area.</p> 
						<p>I am a huge fan of the Beatles, and have had the privilege of playing Beatle&apos;s music (George&apos;s guitar parts) on stage with Laurence Juber (former wings lead guitarist), Mark Hudson (The Hudson Brothers & Ringo&apos;s producer), Joey Molland (Badfinger), Billy J. Kramer (Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas), and Beatle tribute bands Revolution (Featuring Tim Piper as John Lennon) & Band On The Run.</p>
						<p>I am as comfortable on the guitar as I am on bass.  I even play drums on occasion.</p>
						<p>Most recently I has been playing in and around Jacksonville with &quot;The Splinters&quot;, &quot;Dialtone&quot;, &quot;Why Me&quot; and now &quot;Top Shelf Band&quot;.  Although not a schooled musician, I can listen to a song and know the tune before it has completed.</p>
