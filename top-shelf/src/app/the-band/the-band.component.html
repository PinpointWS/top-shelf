	        		<div class="my-3">I started playing keyboards when at 13 years old.  My mother was a great pianist and had a major influence on my love of music.  At 15, I started playing with bands in Jacksonville.  I joined a group called The Neutrons that later became Two Shades of Soul.  I have performed with many well-known artists including BB King, Clarence Carter, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. I enjoy song writing and have written and co-written several songs.</div>

	        		<div class="pl-3">After volunteer drumming for several years at various churches in Jacksonville and also the Clay County Community Concert and Swing Band in Orange Park, I began attending jam sessions with local talent. This lead to sitting in with various bands and meeting the right fit of talent that makes up Top Shelf band. "Top Shelf is the right fit and mix of music, and people that I choose to dedicate my time and talent to. We are blessed with wonderful musicians and vocalists! This provides us with a wide variety of music selections to choose from because of the range of our vocalists, plus we can add great harmony!"Backup vocals is a specialty of mine. "Adding harmony is a natural ability that I am grateful for."</div>

	        		<p>I grew up in Orlando, FL in a home with no rock and roll music.  I started playing the guitar in high school and began playing music in bars and clubs in 1974.  Over time this became a full time touring gig playing bars and clubs around the country until 1983.  There were many years of playing over 300 nights a year and we opened many shows for national acts such as The Allman Brothers, Molly Hatchet, 38 Special, Tom Petty, Pat Benatar, Cheap Trick, Rare Earth and Joan Jett.  In 2013, I picked up the guitar for the first time in 30 years and literally have not put it down since.  I&apos;m so thankful that I rediscovered the guitar and found great musicians to play with.  There is nothing like seeing people react to music &mdash; a smile, tap of the toe, singing the lyrics or dancing on the floor. </p>

	        		<p>I was bitten by the music bug on 9 February, 1964 and bought my first guitar for $15 in later that year.  I have been playing music ever since. My first band was formed in 1967 and was called &quot;The Mod 3&quot;. I gigged my way through high school playing the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Black Sabbath, Iron Butterfly, CCR, Grand Funk Railroad, and many other artists from that era. In 1973, I started playing the Bass and played and recorded with a band called Fantasy. In 1974, I enlisted in the Navy and performed with a band everywhere I was stationed. Played all the Bermuda service clubs in 1981, on the flight deck of the US Aircraft Carrier (USS Saratoga CV-60) as she transited the Suez Canal in 1990, as well as, playing with bands in Subic Bay, PI in 1988, Diego Garcia BIOT in 1995, and many other ports around the world. I retired from the Navy in 1997.  From 1998 - 2002, I played bass and provided and operated the sound equipment for the band &quot;High Tide&quot; Jacksonville Beaches area.I am a huge fan of the Beatles, and have had the privilege of playing Beatle&apos;s music (George’s guitar parts) on stage with Laurence Juber (former wings lead guitarist), Mark Hudson (The Hudson Brothers & Ringo&apos;s producer), Joey Molland (Badfinger), Billy J. Kramer (Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas), and Beatle tribute bands Revolution (Featuring Tim Piper as John Lennon) & Band On The Run. I am as comfortable on the guitar as I am on bass.  I even play drums on occasion. Most recently I has been playing in and around Jacksonville with &quot;The Splinters&quot;, &quot;Dialtone&quot;, &quot;Why Me&quot; and now &quot;Top Shelf Band&quot;.  Although not a schooled musician, I can listen to a song and know the tune before it has completed.</p>
